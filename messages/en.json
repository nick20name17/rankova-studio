          "Description": "It all started with a love of music and a desire to teach others. After returning from studying in Poland and working in China, I wanted to share the experience I had gained there and be useful in my hometown of Rivne.",
          "FullStory": {
            "Paragraph1": "It all started with online vocal lessons during the pandemic, then moved offline, and later piano lessons and cooperation with another teacher were added. There were many people interested. That’s how the idea to expand was born — so that everyone who wants to make music can do it. My dream was supported by Maksym Vorozhko and Oleksii Karchevskyi, who joined me on this journey.",
            "Paragraph2": "We spent a year building the studio. We put a lot of work and effort into making it a comfortable space for students to engage in music. We wanted them to feel no worse than abroad and to be proud that in Rivne, too, things can be modern. And it’s not only about the space and equipment, but also about our approach to music education.",
            "Paragraph3": "Later, we decided to create a place that would unite talented and creative people even more. 'Soul Place' is a space for our students’ performances and various creative events aimed at developing the musical culture of Rivne."
